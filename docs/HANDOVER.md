# AADS HANDOVER
최종 업데이트: 2026-05-04

## 2026-05-04
- Android Agent Galaxy Z Fold6 remote-control follow-up: `runner-4f922625` code implementation is committed in `aads-server` as `05c7dc7`; follow-up sensor JSON hardening skips non-finite values during `JSONArray` serialization.
- Chat visibility fix: `runner_response` assistant messages are no longer hidden by backend/dashboard message filters, so saved AI review/status reports remain visible in the main chat timeline.
- Pipeline Runner docs/config: AADS per-project concurrency is documented/configured as `MAX_CONCURRENT_PER_PROJECT=6`; global limit remains 10.
- Technical record added: `docs/reports/20260504_ANDROID_AGENT_CHAT_VISIBILITY_TECHNICAL.md`.
- Caution: `runner-4f922625` has finalize/deploy timeout history. Future deploy-complete reports require fresh health/API/APK download verification.
